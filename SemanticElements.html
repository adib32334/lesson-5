                        Did you know that mosquitoes’ mouthparts are helping to develop pain-free surgical needles? Who'd have thought that the
                        humble mussel could inspire so many useful things, from plywood production to a “glue” that can cement the crowns on
                        teeth? Or that the design of polar bear fur may one day help keep humans warm in space? In everything from fashion to
                        architecture, medicine to transportation, it may surprise you how many extraordinary inventions have been inspired by
                        the natural world.
                        
                        Take the woodpecker as one incredible example. Woodpeckers can face up to 1,2000 Gs of force, but they’re protected from
                        brain damage by the design of their beaks and skulls. These marvels of nature have inspired an array of cutting-edge
                        ideas, from an advanced black box recorder for airplanes to an exceptionally strong bike helmet. In 30 Animals That Made
                        Us Smarter, join wildlife biologist, TV host, and BBC podcaster Patrick Aryee as he tells stories of biomimicry, or
                        innovations inspired by the natural world, which enrich our lives every day—and in some cases, save them.
                        
                        With Aryee’s infectious curiosity and sense of wonder as inspiration, venture with us into the hidden world of
                        biomimicry. 30 Animals That Made Us Smarter will reveal animals’ exceptional powers and change the way you look at the
